# Problem 1

``` r
set.seed(123)

samp_df = tibble(
  samp = rnorm(10, mean = 0),
  logical_vector = samp > 0,
  chara_vector = c("This", "is", "homework", "one", "from", "Renee", "This", "is", "a", "homework"),
  fac_vector = factor(c("A", "A", "A", "B", "B", "B", "B", "C", "C", "C"))
)
```

The mean of samples drawn from the normal distribution is 0.0746256. The
mean of the logical vector is 0.5. The mean of the character vector is
NA. The mean of the factor vector is NA.

``` r
as.numeric(pull(samp_df,samp))
```

The mean of the numeric vector, logical vector can be calculated
directly but not character vector and factor vector. This can be
partially explained by the as.numeric() cast result: there is no
reasonable way to cast the character vector as a numeric vector, thus we
also cannot take its mean. However, although as.numeric() works for the
factor vector, we still cannot take its mean. This is because factors
are stored as numeric variable with their level internally â€“ they are
not scalar, thus mean() cannot be applied on a factor vector.

# Problem 2

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

The data penguins is a data frame including the following columns:
species, island, bill\_length\_mm, bill\_depth\_mm, flipper\_length\_mm,
body\_mass\_g, sex, year. One sample from the data frame is as follows:
Adelie, Torgersen, 42, 20.2, 190, 4250, NA, 2007. There are 344 rows and
8 columns. The mean of the flipper length is 200.9152047.

``` r
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm), na.rm = TRUE) + geom_point(aes(color = species), na.rm = TRUE)
```
